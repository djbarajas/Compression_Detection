# Compression Detection

This project is an implementation of end-to-end compression detection of network traffic flows by intermediaried inspired by the research of Vahab Pournaghshband, Alexander Afanasyev, and Peter Reiher. 

The range of detection control through the reading expressed its sensitivity to the layer in which we implement our observation and expressed the possibility of encountering servers with different levels of compliance.

To narrow the varieties of implementation, we decided to restrict our methods to detect TCP/IP compression events with the possibilty of encountering either a cooperative or responsive server.
